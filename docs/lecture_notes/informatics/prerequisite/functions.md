# Functions

A function is a pointer to some code, parameterized by formal parameters, that may be executed by providing actual parameters. Functions must be **declared before they are used**, but code may be provided later. For example, a sqrt function that returns the given integer parameter $$n$$ might be declared as:

``` c
int echo(int n) {
    return n;
}
```
